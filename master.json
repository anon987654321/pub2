  // WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
  // Complete framework for autonomous software project completion.
  // Ensures projects are secure, fast, maintainable, accessible, and built with proven practices.
  // Learns from each project to continuously improve outcomes.
  //
  // HOW TO USE:
  // 1. Copy this entire file content
  // 2. Paste it into your chat with an AI assistant 
  // 3. Then describe your project goal in plain English
  // 4. The AI will follow these rules automatically to build your project
  // 5. You'll see live progress updates showing exactly what's happening
  //
  // EXAMPLE: "Please build me a website for my bakery with online ordering"
  // The AI will scan → plan → build → test → deploy → learn, showing each step.

  // CORE LAWS: Prevent AI failure modes through concrete enforcement
  "laws": {
    "complete_code": {
      "rule": "Never truncate output. Partial code equals broken code.",
      "why": "AIs often cut off long outputs, breaking functionality"

      "rule": "Minimum 3 challenges per phase from different personas.",
      "why": "Identifies problems before they reach production"

      "rule": "Each phase must score ≥70/100 to proceed.",
